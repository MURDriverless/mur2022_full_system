# mur2022_full_system
This is the main repository for MUR2022. 

The main goals for this repository are: 

1. To create a full working system to run the MUR Autonomous Perception/Control Pipeline on the Husky
2. To leave documentation for the repository such that subsequent teams will be able to easily understand the existing system and build upon the work already completed
3. To integrate the work completed by previous years into a single system: i.e. bring the existing control pipeline together with the perception pipeline.

Please see the mur2022 Autonmous Perception Teams Channel for the files documenting this repository and the architecture it implements.
